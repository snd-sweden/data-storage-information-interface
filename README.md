## About the storage manifest
The purpose of this manifest is to integrate the university's research storage with Doris so that the researchers can easily describe, refer to and publish data without data having to leave the university's own storage.

The manifest for describing the storage manifest and files is based on [ro-cate 1.1](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/).
